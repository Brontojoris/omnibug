@TODOs:

 1  Rename (to? WAbug?) (* Move to httpdocs/wabug/ when doing rename!)

 2  Vendor-specific rules, chooser, and pref entries (and new logic model)
      Omniture (√)
      Moniforce (√)
      WebTrends (√)
      GoogleAnalytics (√)
      Sophus3?
      Custom
    - add a vendor-specific logo to the displayo, perhaps?

 3  add pattern preference input box (how does this work with #2?)

 4  fix clear button weirdness

 4.5  changes to follow patterns from http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug-tutorial/extending-firebug-hello-world-part-i/ (1√, 2√, 3√, 4, 5 )

 6  icon (not just puzzle piece)

 7  real prefs screen (to support #2,3 above)

 8  hosted by moz?

 9  update build process to use svn rev as build #, not version #

 9.5 private build process, for developing

 15  switch from innerHTML/appendHTML to DOM (via domplate?)

 16  submit to WA blogs/sites/etc?

 18  file format -> quoted csv (need to escape quotes inside?)

 20  add new summary fields to file output (talk to Powers first) (18 and 20 okay by Powers)

 22  Investigate global use of context.loaded vs. onStateChange's doneLoading flags.  Are they different?  Do we need both?

 23  add try/catch around some/everything?

 24  define release test criteria and stick to it

 25  switch to observers instead of onStateChange?

------

@DONE:

 11  instead of calling initPrefs(), add prefs observer service to call it (or something like it)

 13  table-ize data

 14  trim displayed full url and display in expanded version?

  5  platform-specific images (not just win)

 21  Use 'workspace' variables (e.g. context.omnibug.requests, not context.requests), so it plays nice with other extensions

 17  fix prob relayed by sophus (timing and requests staying in queue)

 12  names for known keys (e.g. pev2 -> "Page Event 2") (per-vendor)

 27  get added to http://getfirebug.com/extensions/

 26  http status thinger

------

FBTrace.dumpProperties( "browser", context.browser );
Firebug.Console.log( ... );
