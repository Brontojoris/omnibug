@TODOs:

 1  Rename (to? WAbug?)

 2  Vendor-specific rules, chooser, and pref entries (and new logic model)
      Omniture (√)
      Moniforce (√)
      WebTrends (√)
      GoogleAnalytics (√)
      Sophus3?
      Custom
    - add a vendor-specific logo to the displayo, perhaps?

 3  add pattern preference input box (how does this work with #2?)

 4  fix clear button weirdness
 
 4.5  changes to follow patterns from http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/firebug-tutorial/extending-firebug-hello-world-part-i/ (i√, ii, iii, iv,v )

 6  icon (not just puzzle piece)

 7  real prefs screen (to support #2,3 above)

 8  hosted by moz?

 9  update build process to use svn rev as build #, not version #

 9.5 private build process, for developing

 10  dump prefs?

 12  names for known keys (e.g. pev2 -> "Page Event 2") (per-vendor)

 15  switch from innerHTML/appendHTML to DOM (via domplate?)

 16  submit to WA blogs/sites/etc?

 17  fix prob relayed by sophus (timing and requests staying in queue)

 18  file format -> quoted csv (need to escape quotes inside?)

 20  add new summary fields to file output (talk to Powers first)

------

@DONE:

 11  instead of calling initPrefs(), add prefs observer service to call it (or something like it)

 13  table-ize data

 14  trim displayed full url and display in expanded version?

 5  platform-specific images (not just win)
