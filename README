      Sophus3?
      Custom

 3  add pattern preference input box (how does this work with #2?)

 4  fix clear button weirdness

 5  platform-specific images (not just win)

 6  icon (not just puzzle piece)

 7  real prefs screen (to support #2 above)

 8  hosted by moz?

 9  update build process to use svn rev as build #, not version #

 9.5 private build process, for developing

 10  dump prefs?

 12  names for known keys (e.g. pev2 -> "Page Event 2")

 14  trim displayed full url and display in expanded version?

 15  switch from innerHTML/appendHTML to DOM

------

@DONE:
